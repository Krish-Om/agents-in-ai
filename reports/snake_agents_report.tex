\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

Intelligent agents represent fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence systems, characterized by their ability to perceive environmental states and execute actions to achieve specific objectives. The Snake game provides an ideal testbed for comparing different agent architectures due to its well-defined state space, clear objectives, and dynamic challenges requiring both tactical and strategic decision-making.

This study implements and compares five distinct agent architectures: Simple Reflex Agent, Goal-Based Agent, Utility-Based Agent, Model-Based Agent, and Q-Learning Agent. Each represents a different paradigm in artificial intelligence, from reactive systems that respond to immediate stimuli to learning systems that adapt through experience.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement five different intelligent agent architectures for the Snake game environment
\item Compare performance characteristics and decision-making capabilities of each agent type
\item Analyze the progression from reactive to learning-based artificial intelligence
\item Evaluate the trade-offs between computational complexity and performance effectiveness
\item Demonstrate the evolution from hand-coded intelligence to machine-learned intelligence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

Each agent was implemented using Python and tested in a consistent Snake game environment. The evaluation methodology includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of agent-specific decision-making algorithms
\item Performance measurement through gameplay sessions
\item Comparative analysis of behavioral patterns and strategies
\item Documentation of code implementations and architectural decisions
\end{itemize}

% ===================== AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS =====================
\section{Agent Implementations}

This section presents the implementation details and experimental results for each intelligent agent architecture.

\subsection{Simple Reflex Agent}

\subsubsection{Description}
The Simple Reflex Agent implements the most basic form of intelligent behavior, making decisions based solely on the current perceptual input. This agent reacts to the immediate position of the apple relative to the snake's head, attempting to move toward the target if the path is safe. The agent operates without memory, planning capabilities, or learning mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Simple Reflex Agent]
def simple_agent(game):
    head_x, head_y = game.snake.x[0], game.snake.y[0]
    apple_x, apple_y = game.apple.x, game.apple.y

    if apple_x < head_x:
        next_x, next_y = game._get_potential_head("left")
        if not game._is_potential_move_colliding(next_x, next_y):
            game.snake.move_left()
            return
    if apple_x > head_x:
        next_x, next_y = game._get_potential_head("right")
        if not game._is_potential_move_colliding(next_x, next_y):
            game.snake.move_right()
            return
    if apple_y > head_y:
        next_x, next_y = game._get_potential_head("down")
        if not game._is_potential_move_colliding(next_x, next_y):
            game.snake.move_down()
            return
    if apple_y < head_y:
        next_x, next_y = game._get_potential_head("up")
        if not game._is_potential_move_colliding(next_x, next_y):
            game.snake.move_up()
            return
# No fallback strategy
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Results and Analysis}
The Simple Reflex Agent demonstrates basic navigation capabilities but exhibits significant limitations in complex scenarios. The agent successfully moves toward the apple when direct paths are available but fails when obstacles require strategic maneuvering. Performance is limited by the absence of planning and memory mechanisms.

\subsection{Goal-Based Agent}

\subsubsection{Description}
The Goal-Based Agent represents a significant advancement over reactive systems by incorporating explicit goal formulation and planning mechanisms. This agent defines clear objectives including collision avoidance, apple acquisition, score maximization, and safety maintenance. The implementation utilizes sophisticated search algorithms including A* and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute optimal paths to target locations.

    if Goals.REACH_APPLE in current_goals:
        path_to_apple = a_star_search(game, (head_x, head_y), (apple_x, apple_y))

            return

    # Goal 4: AVOID_DEATH - Emergency survival mode
    emergency_move(game)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Results and Analysis}
The Goal-Based Agent demonstrates superior performance compared to the Simple Reflex Agent through strategic planning and multi-step lookahead capabilities. The hierarchical goal system enables intelligent priority management, with survival taking precedence over score optimization. The A* search algorithm provides optimal pathfinding when computational resources permit, while BFS serves as a fallback mechanism for broader exploration.

% ===================== UTILITY-BASED AGENT =====================
\subsection{Utility-Based Agent}

\subsubsection{Description}
The Utility-Based Agent implements a sophisticated decision-making framework by evaluating each possible action through a comprehensive utility function. This agent considers multiple factors including food attraction, safety assessment, spatial availability, and movement efficiency. The utility-based approach allows for flexible preference modeling and multi-criteria optimization, representing a significant advancement over simple goal-based systems.

\subsubsection{Results and Analysis}
The Utility-Based Agent demonstrates sophisticated decision-making capabilities through its multi-factor evaluation system. The utility function successfully balances competing objectives, showing improved performance in scenarios requiring trade-offs between immediate rewards and long-term safety. The agent exhibits flexible behavior adaptation based on weighted preference combinations.

\subsection{Model-Based Agent}

\subsubsection{Description}
The Model-Based Agent represents a paradigm shift toward adaptive intelligence through the maintenance of an internal world model and experience-based learning mechanisms. This agent continuously updates its understanding of game dynamics, remembers dangerous positions, tracks successful strategies, and adapts its decision-making based on accumulated knowledge. The implementation demonstrates key principles of model-based reinforcement learning and adaptive behavior.

The Q-Learning Agent represents the pinnacle of autonomous intelligence in this study, implementing reinforcement learning principles to discover optimal strategies through trial-and-error exploration. This agent maintains a Q-table containing quality scores for state-action pairs, utilizing a simplified state representation to address the curse of dimensionality inherent in complex game environments. The learning mechanism incorporates reward signals (+50 for apple acquisition, -100 for collisions, -1 per movement) and employs the Bellman equation for value function updates.

\item \textbf{Q-Learning Algorithm}: Implements tabular Q-learning with Bellman equation updates for value function approximation
\item \textbf{Exploration vs Exploitation}: Employs epsilon-greedy strategy with 10\% random exploration and 90\% greedy exploitation for balanced learning
\item \textbf{Reward Engineering}: Structured reward system with +50 for apple acquisition, -100 for collisions, and -1 per movement to encourage efficient gameplay
\item \textbf{Persistent Learning}: Maintains Q-table persistence through JSON serialization for continuous improvement across gaming sessions
\item \textbf{Learning Parameters}: Configured with learning rate $\alpha=0.1$ and discount factor $\gamma=0.95$ for optimal convergence
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Results and Analysis}
The Q-Learning Agent demonstrates the remarkable capability of autonomous learning, progressively improving performance through experience accumulation. Initial episodes show random exploratory behavior, gradually transitioning to strategic gameplay as the Q-table develops. The agent exhibits superior long-term learning potential compared to all previous implementations, representing true adaptive artificial intelligence.

\section{Conclusion}

This research successfully implemented and evaluated five intelligent agent architectures for the Snake game environment, demonstrating the evolution from basic reactive systems to sophisticated learning-based artificial intelligence.

\subsection{Key Findings}
The experimental results demonstrate clear performance hierarchies among the implemented agent types:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Simple Reflex Agent}: Basic reactive behavior with limited planning capabilities
\item \textbf{Goal-Based Agent}: Strategic planning through A* and BFS search algorithms
\item \textbf{Utility-Based Agent}: Multi-criteria decision-making with flexible preference modeling
