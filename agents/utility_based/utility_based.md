# Utility based agent

Utility-based agents are designed to make decisions that optimize their performance by evaluating the preferences (or utilities) for each possible state. These agents assess multiple alternatives and choose the one that maximizes their utility, which is a measure of how desirable or "happy" a state is for the agent.

Achieving the goal is not always sufficient; for example, the agent might prefer a quicker, safer, or cheaper way to reach a destination.
The utility function is essential for capturing this concept, mapping each state to a real number that reflects the agentâ€™s happiness or satisfaction with that state.
Since the world is often uncertain, utility-based agents choose actions that maximize expected utility, ensuring they make the most favorable decision under uncertain conditions.
